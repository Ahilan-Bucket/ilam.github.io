    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I am a physics undergraduate working at the intersection of computational science,
      social justice, and community-focused technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      AKF is a personal research and creative space where I document experiments,
      develop computational tools, and explore how scientific methods can be made
      useful beyond academic boundaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      One long-term project I am developing is a flood-level simulation framework for
      Chennai, designed to support early warning, resource planning, and decision-making
      in informal settlements where conventional data sources are limited.
